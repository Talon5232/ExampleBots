Comparing Code V1 to V2(This version)
All help us become more accurate and consitent, and accuracy + consitency is always good. 
Encoder Data for Drivetrain is now displayed on shuffleboard. 
Drivetrain encoder Data is now used in auto to give us a slightly more accurate auto.
Gyro data is now displayed, and used to help us turn slightly in auto. 
This leads us to an improved auto which is very important in being a top team, or a team that will get picked during tournament times.
Once we have experienced the intro to encoders and data we can start to increase the difficulty.
The addition of Cameras to the shuffleboard allows us to see the field much more easily. 
This helps us imporve our drivers accuracy when manuevering the field during gameplay. 



!! I want to see you implement the new information learned to create a auto that uses Gyro and Encoder data instead of time !!
This will help you understand what you have learned so far. 
Think critically, gyros in its most basic config will allow you find the angle the robot has turned, and encoders will allow you to track how far a bot has moved with quite consistent results. 
If you have Questions or Concerns you know where to find me.
